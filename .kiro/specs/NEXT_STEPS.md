# NEXT_STEPS.md — Rolling Operational Memo

> 高階、滾動、可覆寫。跨 spec 當前狀態與恢復點。詳細真相見各 spec artifact。

## Current State (2026-06-11)

- **Current branch lane:** `spec/e-lite-source-f-hardening`, branched from `dev` after PR #9 merge.
- **Latest evidence:** `uv run pytest -q` → **156 passed**; `uv run mypy quantlab/ --ignore-missing-imports` → clean(48 files); `uv run lint-imports` → KEPT; Python mutation spot checks **8/8 killed**; E-lite trace coverage 97.3%; B source-health trace coverage 97.6%; F Next.js tests 6 passed, line coverage 84.37%, build/smoke/mutation passed.
- **Merged:** PR #7 squash-merged to `main` as `6e2af71`; PR #8 squash-merged to `dev` as `1f46725`; PR #9 squash-merged to `dev` as `0eaeaf0`.
- **ISSUE-B3-001 handled in advance:**
  - Promoted/folded into [CR-B7 source health](./b-data-platform/change-requests/cr-b7-source-health.md) for invalid FRED gold proxy defaults.
  - Repo-side fix: default FRED price proxy list now uses reachable `PCOPPUSDM` commodity proxy instead of invalid London gold IDs.
  - Promoted/folded into [CR-B8 Yahoo chart fallback](./b-data-platform/change-requests/cr-b8-yahoo-chart-fallback.md) for TSMC/TWSE fallback capture and PIT loading.
  - Promoted/folded into [CR-B9 Stooq opt-in](./b-data-platform/change-requests/cr-b9-stooq-opt-in.md); Stooq is no longer a default daily snapshot source.
  - Residual: Stooq itself remains external/source-contract blocked; TSMC/TWSE fallback is live-smoke proven through Yahoo chart from this environment.
- **Epic D first slice:** [d-first-regime-model](./d-first-regime-model/) is **Implemented(first slice) · Review PASSED**.
  - Added `RegimeSignal`, `RegimeFeatureBuilder`, `FirstRegimeClassifier`, and `RegimeAllocationStrategy`.
  - Targeted D evidence: 6 tests for PIT-safe signal and OOS-net baseline integration.
  - Conservative writeup: synthetic data proves pipeline correctness only; no alpha claim.
- **Epic C C-3:** time/regime rebalance selector implemented additively in `quantlab/portfolio/rebalance.py`; A0 engine scheduling now consumes it through CR-A0.
- **A0/C regime scheduling:** [CR-A0](./a0-backtest-foundation/change-requests/cr-a0-regime-rebalance-scheduling.md) lets the vectorized engine execute C-3 regime-selected dates through serializable `rebalance_policy` labels.
- **Mutation automation:** [mutation automation report](./a0-backtest-foundation/reports/mutation-automation-report.md) adds `scripts/run_mutation_spot_checks.py`; current suite kills 6/6 configured mutations.
- **D-3 real-source-format benchmark:** [real-data regime benchmark report](./d-first-regime-model/reports/real-data-regime-benchmark-report.md) adds vintage-loader-based OOS-net baseline comparison with explicit `no_alpha_claim`.
- **F showcase first slice:** [f-showcase-read-api-dashboard](./f-showcase-read-api-dashboard/) is **Implemented(repo-side read API/dashboard payload) · Review PASSED**.
  - Added `ShowcaseReadAPI`, dashboard summary builder, and deterministic HTML smoke renderer.
  - Live-demo readiness is **CONDITIONAL / hybrid** until a real Next.js runtime and browser evidence exist.
- **D return/risk second model slice:** [d-return-risk-forecast-model](./d-return-risk-forecast-model/) is **Implemented · Review PASSED**.
  - Added deterministic PIT-safe `ReturnRiskForecaster`, `ForecastAllocationStrategy`, and OOS-net benchmark helper.
  - Conservative writeup: no alpha claim; Tier3 MLOps remains deferred.
- **F real Next.js dashboard:** [f-nextjs-showcase-dashboard](./f-nextjs-showcase-dashboard/) is **Implemented · Review PASSED** for local runtime proof.
  - Added contained `frontend/` Next.js app, `/api/showcase`, component tests, mutation check, build, and local HTTP smoke.
  - Public hosting and visual regression remain deferred.
- **D robust optimizer third model family:** [d-robust-portfolio-optimization-model](./d-robust-portfolio-optimization-model/) is **Implemented · Review PASSED**.
  - Added downside-penalized robust optimizer strategy and OOS-net benchmark helper.
- **E Tier3 readiness / E-lite:** [e-mlops-tier3-readiness.md](./e-mlops-tier3-readiness.md) moved E to planning-ready; [e-mlops-tier3-lite](./e-mlops-tier3-lite/) is **Implemented · Review PASSED** for registry-only experiment lineage.
- **B source-health follow-up:** [CR-B10](./b-data-platform/change-requests/cr-b10-source-health-registry.md) is **Implemented(repo-side)**; source status summaries are explicit and do not re-enable blocked Stooq defaults.
- **F demo hardening:** [f-demo-hardening](./f-demo-hardening/) is **Implemented · Review PASSED**; dashboard now exposes `local_demo_only`, `not_proven` public hosting/visual regression, and dependency audit posture.

## Recommended Next Action

1. Commit and push `spec/e-lite-source-f-hardening`.
2. Open PR into `dev`.
3. Next lane candidate after merge: public deployment/dependency remediation for F, or optional G alt-data.

## Scheduled Ops

- Daily vintage snapshot routine is expected to continue writing append-only files under `data/vintage/raw/<date>/`.
- Current live proof says routine/source health is partial: Yahoo fallback is proven for `2330.TW` and `^TWII` on 2026-06-11; Stooq remains opt-in/blocked.

## Resume Hints

- For test truth, read [quantlab/TESTS.md](../../quantlab/TESTS.md) then [.agents/specs/TESTS.md](./TESTS.md).

## Key Locked Decisions

- 個人自用純紙上;成功=方法論誠實度 + 實驗能力,非 alpha;雙目的(作品集 + lab)→ 兩速結構。
- 每模型 DoD:A0 產出「可與笨 baseline 並排比較的 OOS 報告」。
- 三框架(PyTorch/TF/JAX)harness 無感;Tier1+2 進 A0,Tier3(完整 MLOps)延後。
